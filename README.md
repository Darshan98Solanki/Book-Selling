# Book-Selling Platform

A full-stack web application built using the MERN stack to facilitate an online marketplace for books. This platform enables users to buy and sell books by creating an account, giving a seamless experience for book lovers and independent sellers. I have created frontend for this project.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Book Listings**: Sellers can list books, while buyers can view details of available books.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by title, author, genre, or price.
- **Cart System**: Buyers can add books to a cart before purchasing.
- **Order Management**: Track orders and manage purchases with ease.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darshan98Solanki/Book-Selling.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Book-Selling
   ```
3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Register or log in to access the platformâ€™s features.
2. As a buyer, search for books or browse through the catalog, and add selected books to the cart.
3. As a seller, list books for sale by providing title, author, genre, and price details.

## Technologies Used
